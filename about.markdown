## About Me

I live in Seattle. I have a cat and a wife, but not necessarily in that order. I hack on lots of stuff, often with [Seattle.rb][]. I don't get a lot of sleep. I have a history of abandoning blogs.

## Colophon

I lifted every good visual idea on these pages from [TPW][] or [Khoi Vinh][]. Underlying bits are [Jekyll][] and [Markdown][] on [GitHub Pages][].
