## About Me

I live in Seattle. I have a cat and a wife, but not necessarily in that order. I hack on lots of stuff, often with [Seattle.rb][]. I don't get a lot of sleep. I have a history of abandoning blogs. If you're security-conscious, I have a [public key][].

[Seattle.rb]: http://www.seattlerb.org
[public key]: /personal/jbarnette.txt

## Colophon

I lifted every good visual idea on these pages from [TPW][] or [Khoi Vinh][]. Underlying bits are [Jekyll][] and [Markdown][] on [GitHub Pages][].
